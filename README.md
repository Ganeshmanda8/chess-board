<!-- This HTML document represents a chessboard using HTML and CSS. The chessboard and its pieces are represented by div elements with different classes and styles.
<br>
The <!DOCTYPE html> declaration helps with browser compatibility. The <html> tag is the root of the HTML document. The <head> tag contains meta-information about the document, such as its character encoding (<meta charset="utf-8">), viewport settings (<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">), and the document title (<title>Chess Board</title>).
<br>
The <style> tag within the <head> tag contains CSS rules that style the chessboard and its pieces. The .if class styles the outer container of the chessboard, .id styles the chessboard itself, and .ia and .ib style the individual squares of the chessboard. The .ia:hover,.ib:hover rule changes the font size of a square when it is hovered over.
<br>
The <body> tag contains the content of the HTML document. The <center> tag, which is now obsolete in HTML5, is used to center the chessboard on the page. The <div class="if"> element is the outer container of the chessboard, and the <div class="id"> element is the chessboard itself.
<br>
The individual squares of the chessboard are represented by <div class="ia"> and <div class="ib"> elements. The chess pieces are represented by HTML entities (e.g., &#9814; for the white king) within these div elements. The style="color: red;" attribute changes the color of the pieces to red.
<br>
The empty <div class="ia"> and <div class="ib"> elements represent empty squares on the chessboard. The arrangement of <div class="id"> element is the chessboard itself.The arrangement of these div elements within the <div class="id"> element represents the initial setup of a chess game. -->
